# fission_fusion_v2
This is an attempt to model the behavior of a herd looking for food (think buffalo finding grazing sites). Agent behavior is modeled using an FSM. Currently a work in progress. Done as part of a research project with Dr. Michael A. Goodrich at Brigham Young University, 2023.
# TODO
- fix movement when factoring site positions

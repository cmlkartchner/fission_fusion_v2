# fission_fusion_v2
This is an attempt to model the behavior of a herd looking for food (think buffalo finding grazing sites). Agent behavior is modeled using an FSM. Currently a work in progress. Done as part of a research project with Dr. Michael A. Goodrich at Brigham Young University, 2023.

# repulsion branch features
This branch attempts to imitate grouping behaviors by assigning agents to groups. They attract to those of the same group and repel from agents who are from different groups. The groups are color coded.

The agents also have extended site memory, which can be extended or shortened in config.py.
